# YAHAS = ESP8266 + RaspberryPi + Android
YAHAS (Yet Another Home Automatin System) is a self-consistent system for maker users, it is built on ESP8266 microcontroller (agent node), Raspberry Pi (manager node) and Android smartphone (control node).

Particular attention has been paid to security, in fact a local cloud (node manager) is used and access to the system from the Internet is achieved via SSL certificate.
